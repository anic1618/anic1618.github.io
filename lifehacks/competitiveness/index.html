            <p>Competitiveness isn’t inherently good or bad, It can be motivating, encourage people to push themselves, expand their capacities and capabilities, and perform at a high level. Where it’s bad is where we compete in ways that are bad for other people.</p>
<p>If winning the competition becomes the ultimate goal you may be willing to sacrifice things along the way that could be very bad.</p>
<p>As per Psychology, we found that hypercompetitive individuals — those who have a need to win at all cost — were more impatient and irritable than their less-competitive counterparts and had higher self-reported health problems, including heart disease. Hypercompetitive people to be highly narcissistic and to have lower self-esteem and higher rates of anxiety and depression than others. That research painted hypercompetitive people as in need of constant validation, which they seek through a “ceaseless round of social activities”—a performance load that inevitably causes them to fall short of their goals and “feel perpetually dissatisfied.</p>
<p>One of the dangers of a competitive personality is that even non-competitiveness situations can become competitive, and that ruins your hedonistic experience or enjoyment of the moment,</p>
<p>When people try to manage the impressions others have of them, “they create a cascade of unintended negative consequences for both themselves and others. In contrast, when people try to contribute to the well-being of other people, they create a cascade of positive consequences for both themselves and others.”</p>
<p>People too often confuse success (doing well) with winning (doing better than others). According to scores of studies, the more you&rsquo;re led to focus on triumphing over others, the less well you&rsquo;ll end up doing on most tasks, particularly over the long haul</p>
<p>As per one of the report published in Journal of Cross Cultural Psychology, It is found that people motivated by bettering themselves had higher job satisfaction, subjective well-being and overall satisfaction with their lives compared to those who were primarily motivating by outperforming others.</p>
<h3 id="copying-strategies">Copying strategies</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The ideal arrangement</p>
<p>The ideal arrangement is cooperation, where my success depends on your success.
The second-best arrangement is goal independence, where my success is unaffected by your success.
The worst arrangement is competition, where my success requires your failure.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on a goal that is about self-mastery rather than one about beating others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the emotions that accompany your competitiveness have any fear or negativity, try to release the critical voice. Ask: What is the best feeling I can have for this task without it involving dominating or conquering anyone else?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watch the language you use around competition. Aim for striving, passion, possibility and “us,” and turn away from fear, victory, glory and “me.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the difference between your outcome goals and your purpose. The metaphorical scoreboard is an outcome. Your purpose is why you do it, and how it enriches you and others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice gratitude. Thank—silently or otherwise—each person who helped positively shape your capabilities. “Perhaps someone will be thanking you, too,” she says.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you feel yourself getting angry or irritable, ask yourself, &ldquo;Is it because I&rsquo;m jealous?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To figure out why things triggers, spend some time writing about it in a journal or talking about it with a trusted friend. Keep digging deeper to find the source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-think competitiveness at the moment.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re feeling competitiveness rage up, take a moment to stop yourself and re-think. Is your competitiveness from jealousy? Is your jealousy merited? Try to remember where your jealousy is stemming from. It&rsquo;s usually not from the current situation, so reminding yourself of that fact can help you calm the jealous beast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop making comparisons.</p>
<p>Instead, realize that no one succeeds at the same pace. You are right where you need to be right now, and you are enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check your black and white thinking</p>
<p>In reality, someone else doing well doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re not doing well, nor does it negate how well you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop thinking of love as finite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be compassionate to yourself</p>
<p>Increasing your self-esteem overall helps you become less competitive. Often, if you&rsquo;re a very competitive person, your self-esteem may be dependent on you doing well. If you fail at something, your self-esteem also falls. Learning to hold on to your self-worth no matter the situation can help you become less competitive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work on interpreting situations differently.</p>
<p>For instance, you may blow things out of proportion; you make a mistake and think that everyone sees you as a failure. Instead, try to put that in proportion. Was the mistake really that big a deal? Did anyone actually say that you are a failure or not up to the job?</p>
<p>• Other times, you may take your successes and turn them into failures. For example, you might say, &ldquo;My boss praised that report, but it was only good because I used the numbers from accounting.&rdquo; Instead, it&rsquo;s important to celebrate your successes when they come.</p>
<p>• You might also think that what you&rsquo;re feeling is absolute fact. If you&rsquo;re feeling like an idiot, you may think everyone else sees you that way, too, when in reality, they all likely have respect for you.</p>
<p>• Another way you may interpret situations negatively is to take small, non-relevant indicators as proof that something is wrong. For instance, if you text someone and they don&rsquo;t text back for a few days, you may think, &ldquo;My friend must hate me at the moment,&rdquo; when in reality, there are plenty of reasons they might not have replied, including they may not have seen the text.</p>
<p>• Remember no one is perfect</p>
<p>• Don&rsquo;t forget to adjust your vision of yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on the positive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning to Celebrate Instead of Compete. Have admiration instead of jealousy.</p>
<p>When you start feeling jealous, which can lead to competitiveness, think about all that person did to get where they are. Admire their hard work and determination. You can even ask them how they achieved what they did, so you can learn from them
.Compliment others sincerely. Remember we&rsquo;re all connected</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice gratitude.</p>
